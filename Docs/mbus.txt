This document describes how to setup mbus.

1. Configuration file

   All known mbus implementations read the config file ~/.mbus or if
   the environment variable MBUS set, the file to which this variable
   points. When you first start freevo or a helper application a mbus
   configuration file is created. Please check the variables later. If
   you have mbus applications on different hosts, you need to change
   SCOPE=HOSTLOCAL to SCOPE=LINKLOCAL.

   All applications on the same bus must share most of the values in
   the config file. If ADDRESS or PORT don't match, the applications
   simply won't find each other, if HASHKEY is different, pymbus won't
   deliver the messages. Do not activate ENCRYPTIONKEY, pyMbus doesn't
   support encryption yet.


2. Multicast setup

   Mbus communicates over multicast. Most Linux distributions enable
   multicast in their default kernel. If you build your own kernel,
   make sure multicast is enabled.

   If no special route is given, the multicast traffic will be routed
   through the default route. This may not what you want. E.g. eth0 is
   the uplink and eth1 the private network, eth0 has the default route
   but eth1 should be used for link local mbus communication. A second
   problem may be that the firewall is blocking the communication and
   not even host local communication is possible.

   To set the default route for mbus for 224.255.222.240 (default)
   type 'route add 224.255.222.240 <interface>' is root. For host
   local usage use 'lo' as <interface>.
