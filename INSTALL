Short description:
------------------

   To install Freevo, run 'python setup.py install' as root. If you
   don't want to install Freevo, you can also start Freevo directly in
   the unpacked tarball. 

   You need to have all dependencies installed.




Dependencies:
-------------

Freevo has many dependencies. Based on your distribution, it's more or
less easy to install everything.


o Redhat 9 (and maybe other RPM based distributions)

  There is a list of needed RPMs to install Freevo in
  contrib/rpm/freevo-deps.txt.



o Gentoo:

  You need to update your portage tree with some missing packages. Get
  rsync-freevo at http://freevo.sourceforge.net/gentoo/rsync-freevo
  and start it. You should get a Freevo ebuild. Now you can run
  'emerge freevo' to install Freevo.



o Debian:

  A Debian apt source is available and includes all the dependencies
  you'll need.
  You should add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

  deb http://freevo.sourceforge.net/debian unstable main
  deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main

  (The second source provides mplayer and other multimedia packages)

  Then, simply run apt-get update && apt-get install Freevo to fetch
  all the dependencies you'll need to run Freevo.



o If you want to install Freevo on a different distribution, here is
  a list of all dependencies (some have other dependencies in turn, check the
