Freevo is a Linux application that turns a PC with a TV capture card
and/or TV-out into a standalone multimedia jukebox/VCR. It builds on
other applications such as MPlayer to play and
record video and audio.

Please follow the instructions on the Freevo website! There are more
docs on the Freevo website in a WiKi and in the mailing list archive.

If you have questions, please join the Freevo users mailing list. You
can also send patches, bugreports, docs, plugins, skins and
translations to this list.

Because there was many spam on the list, you can only post a message
when you are subscribed. If you don't want to do this, you can send
mails to freevo@dischi-home.de:

* Bugreports. Please send them to the Freevo mailing list. If you
  are not subscribed to it, send a mail with [Freevo-Bug] in the
  subject to freevo@dischi-home.de.

* Docs. Some plugins are badly documented. If you have some free time,
  please send a small description how to activate and configure the
  plugin. Again, to the freevo user list or with the subject
  [Freevo-DOC] to freevo@dischi-home.de

* Translations. Freevo now has i18n support. Please send us
  translations are corrections in the current translation. Subject
  identifier for freevo@dischi-home.de is [Freevo-i18n]

* Patches. If you find a bug and can fix it, send it to the list or
  use the subject [Freevo-PATCH] and send to freevo@dischi-home.de

* Plugins. If you wrote a nice plugin, we will integrate it. Since it
  can't break anything when it's not active, we will include any
  (usefull) plugin in the Freevo CVS (indentifier [Freevo-Plugin]

Since I don't like spam to the new address freevo@dischi-home.de, all
mails without one of the above identifiers to that adress will be
deleted by procmail.
