Change all imports so that freevo.ui does not need to be in the path.
The following modules have been ported: plugin, event, input, config, 
util, menu. beacon, fxditem, playlist, gui, application, mainmenu,
directory. Now only plugins are missing.

Note: this file is a mix beween several mail on the list. So when it
says 'I', it may not be me :-)


Dischi

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stuff that needs to be done before 1.5

o store metadata for items based on fxd files       (Dischi)
o manual record (with freevo, not the webserver)    (???)


----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many discussions about new features of freevo on the
list/irc. IMHO some are very good ideas, some I don't need. Some are
easy, some are hard to do. A (not compelte) list is:

o better OSD (still in discussion)
o sqlite support (freevo and mmpython)
o support to store metadata to an item/file         (done)
o smb support (automount/handle as media)
o support for dvds on harddisc
o create fxd file on the fly for recorded show      (done)
o plugin support for web- and recordserver
o XML config
o Unified OnScreen plugin config.
  To configure plugins i would like to see a unified plugin
  config. Freevo could call a certain function on each plugin and get
  a dict of option with a list of settings for each option or a "type"
  of setting (directory, file, number, string(to be avoided) ). Then
  we could use that information to make a unified plugin
  configurator. The settings could then be stored (pickle/xml) and
  distributed to the appropriate plugin on startup (or we make the
  plugin's responsible for storing that). This will also take some
  weight off the back of the main config system (because i think it
  will grow a bit beyond managable levels).  
o A directory/file dialog chooser


Smaller items that come to my mind (based on postings) are:

o removing dotfiles in item list                    (done)
o changing the disc id code of mmpython/freevo      (done)


Still on our todo list are:

o live pause for tv
o better bmovl support


And our all-time-favorites:

o docs (user guide, config guide, plugin writing guide, skin files)
o website update
o arts (icons/images/skins)


External plugin:

o Wayne A. Hogue II: mythv plugin
o den_RDC: encoding server



Bugs:

o Selected text in TV guide is invisible (missing font, color set
  wrong?) This is happening in all skins that are shipped with Freevo
o The icons for the TV shows in the guide are stretched horizontally.
  They should be 30x30 but they look to be around 60x30. But in
  Germany 60x30 looks ok. What do to about it?
o The 'barbieri' skins don't work for the TV guide. (moved)
o Certain file types (notably mpeg) are not calculated properly. This
  is the same bug mplayer has with -ss. There seems to be no good way
  to get the length for mpg2 files.
