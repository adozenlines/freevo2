This directory contains a HID (Human Interface Device) file for Sony
Ericsson phones. It is a very simple way to control Freevo with your
phone.

Install on the phone
--------------------

1. Create the hid file. It is a simple tar archive named hid. It has
   to contain the mapping and a background image

    tar -cvf Freevo.hid Freevo.png Remote.kcf

2. Upload via obexftp to the root dir (!) of your phone

   obexftp -b <phone-mac> -B <phone-ftp-channel> -p Freevo.hid


Freevo Configuration
--------------------

When connected the phone will act as keyboard. You have to enable HID
support on your computer. With Gentoo you can do it by setting
HIDD_ENABLE=true in /etc/conf.d/bluetooth and restart the bluetooth
service. Before you can use your phone as remote you have to connect
it as phone with 'hidd connect <phone-mac>'


Status
------

The remote control file only maps the joystick left, right, up, down
and select, the left button to go back and the right button to show
details (e). Other keys are not defined yet.
