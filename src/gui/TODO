o make sure all parts respect the guidelines:
  - no part of freevo is allowed to import osd or skin
  - no part outside the gui code should use the renderer
  - never call screen.clear or osd.clear, everyone cleans up it's own mess

o make it possible to switch backends

o better integration of the settings code

o make animation work again

o clean up the code in widgets:
  This is done for a small set of widgets. PopupBox, AlertBox,
  ConfirmBox and ProgressBox are working again. If someone wants to
  fix the other boxes, please do so (and drop me a note). The design
  is different now:
  - A window is only something that draws on the screen. The label
    inside it has nothing to do with the window. So x/y coordiates are
    based to the screen values, not the parent once (there is no
    parent). 
  - There is no container support, I'm still thinking how and if we
    need it. 
  - Layout is done inside the boxes. If someone wants to re-add the
    LayoutManager, please do so, but don't add hundrets of attributes
    to the objects please, 'style' should be enough.
  - It's simpler now: before the change, a button was a container with
    a border and a label. A label itself was something with text. Now
    a label _is_ a text, a button _is_ a label (only with a different
    drawing function).

o split sdl keyboard into keyboard and sdl poll loop for redraw



If you want to help, just tell me (and ask questions). If you want to
add a backend, look in the README.txt inside the backends dir.
