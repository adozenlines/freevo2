o clean up the code in widgets:
  This is done for a small set of widgets. PopupBox is working again, 
  AlertBox, ConfirmBox and ProgressBox are at least not crashing. 
  If someone wants to fix the other boxes, please do so (and drop me a note). 
  - There is no container support, I'm still thinking how and if we
    need it. 
  - Layout is done inside the boxes. If someone wants to re-add the
    LayoutManager, please do so, but don't add hundrets of attributes
    to the objects please, 'style' should be enough.
  - It's simpler now: before the change, a button was a container with
    a border and a label. A label itself was something with text. Now
    a label _is_ a text, a button _is_ a label (only with a different
    drawing function).

o CLEANUP OLD STUFF I ONLY NEEDED FOR TESTING!!!!


If you want to help, just tell me (and ask questions). If you want to
add a backend, look in the README.txt inside the backends dir.
