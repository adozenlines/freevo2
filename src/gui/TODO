o make sure all parts respect the guidelines:
  o no part of freevo is allowed to import osd or skin
  o no part outside the gui code should use the renderer
  o never call screen.clear or osd.clear, everyone cleans up it's own mess

o make it possible to switch backends

o better integration of the settings code

o make animation work again

o clean up the code in widgets

o split sdl keyboard into keyboard and sdl poll loop for redraw

o define interface for renderer and it's objects
