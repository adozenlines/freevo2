# This file contains some smaller helper functions needed in Freevo and other
# util modules.
#
# TODO: More cleanups here. What need to be here? What is not needed anymore?
#       Split into different files?
#
# Note: I removed some functiosn we don't need anymore to clean up this file.
#       Other functions only needed once are moved to the file were they
#       are needed.

def unique(s):
    """
    Return a list of the elements in s, but without duplicates.

    For example, unique([1,2,3,1,2,3]) is some permutation of [1,2,3],
    unique("abcabc") some permutation of ["a", "b", "c"], and
    unique(([1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 2])) some permutation of
    [[2, 3], [1, 2]].

    For best speed, all sequence elements should be hashable.  Then
    unique() will usually work in linear time.

    If not possible, the sequence elements should enjoy a total
    ordering, and if list(s).sort() doesn't raise TypeError it's
    assumed that they do enjoy a total ordering.  Then unique() will
    usually work in O(N*log2(N)) time.

    If that's not possible either, the sequence elements must support
    equality-testing.  Then unique() will usually work in quadratic
    time.

    # presence of many duplicate elements.  This isn't true of all
    # sort functions in all languages or libraries, so this approach
